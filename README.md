## Project Overview

Objective : Building an e-commerce platform using a .NET API typically involves designing and developing a robust backend service to handle essential functionalities such as managing products, orders, customers, payments, and other core aspects of an e-commerce application. The project might use ASP.NET Core for developing the API, along with other libraries and services like Entity Framework for data access, authentication tools, and cloud-based storage for media. 

## Key Features and Development Focus

### 1. [ Genaric Repository Pattern ]
- Abstraction of data access logic and coordinated repository management to ensure smooth   transactions, provides a flexible and reusable way to interact with data in an application. 

### 2. [ Data transfer object (DTO)  ]
- To separate the internal representation of data from the data that is exposed via the API.


### 3. [ Async programming ]
- Improve performance and scalability by allowing asynchronous operations to be executed without blocking the main thread.

  
### 4. [ Inversion of Control (IoC) ]
-It helps decouple the components of an application, making the system more modular, testable, and maintainable.
